  # to make sonos remote control work, you'll need to expose your sonos devices
  # to the internet through port forwarding (sic!) and register your uplink to a 
  # dyndns service, from this you'll get:
  #
  # - external_hostname:  the dns address you registered at dyndns
  # - internal_ip:        the internal ip of this sonos device, needed for socos' internal
  #                       sanity checks
  # - external_port       the port on your router which forwards to internal_ip:1400

  # this needs to be encoded this way because the environment variables
